Hey there, I'm Robyn. I'm a software engineer living in Vancouver, BC. Recently, I've been building UIs for web apps using React (with TypeScript these days). Before that, I was working as a game developer, mostly using Unity, but also delving into C++.

After work - if I can bring myself to do some more programming - I've been either building this blog using Gatsby, or making games with Godot Engine. When I'm tired of coding but able to sit at my desk for a little while longer, I'm usually either working on some pixel art, gaming, or binging productivity videos while eating overpriced ice cream.

When I'm not at my desk (a rare sight), I like going bouldering, playing tabletop games, or cooking spicy Asian food.

Feel free to send me a message/email if you'd like to talk about any of the above!
