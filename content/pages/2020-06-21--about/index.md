Hey there, I'm Robyn. I'm a software engineer living in Vancouver, BC. Recently, I've been building UIs for web apps
using React (with TypeScript these days). Before that, I was working as a game developer, mostly using Unity, but also
delving into C++.

After work - if I can bring myself to do some more programming - I've been either building this blog using Gatsby, or
making games with Godot Engine. When I'm tired of coding but able to sit at my desk for a little while longer, I'm
usually either working on some
[pixel art](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/i573cf/hello_zuko_here_my_first_serious_piece/), gaming, looking
at pretty keyboards on [r/mk](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards), or
[binging](https://www.youtube.com/c/Thomasfrank/) [productivity](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany)

When I'm not at my desk (a rare sight), I like going bouldering, playing tabletop games, or cooking spicy Asian food.

Feel free to send me a message/email if you'd like to talk about any of the above!
