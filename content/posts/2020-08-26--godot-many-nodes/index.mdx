I recently participated in this year's [GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020) as a solo developer and managed to
finish my first Godot Engine game, [Mimic](https://bitbirdy.itch.io/mimic).

Here's a little clip:

As you can see, it involves having several moving nodes (KinematicBody2Ds). The more of them there are, the lower the
framerate becomes (not shown in the video). There would occasionally be so many nodes that the framerate would drop well
below 30fps.

It seemed like many others were having similar problems so I thought I'd investigate how to optimize many moving physics
bodies. I set up a [demo project](https://github.com/robyn3choi/optimizing-many-nodes) that spawns 1000 bodies and moves
them around. It includes a singlethreaded (ST) version and a multithreaded (MT) version. We'll be going over them in
this article.

Here's what it looks like:

  * Fun fact - I made half of them rotate the opposite direction because watching them all rotate in the same direction
  looked even more nauseating!

Before reading further, make sure you've read about multithreading in the
[Godot Engine docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/threads/using_multiple_threads.html).

## Running on a single thread

`Singlethreaded.tscn` contains `BodySpawnerST` which spawns 1000 bodies at random positions on the screen and randomizes
their rotation directions (`body.left`) when the scene loads.

```gdscript
# BodySpawnerST.gd
extends Node

var body_scene = preload("res://Singlethreaded/BodyST.tscn")
var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()

func _ready() -> void:
	rng.randomize()

	for i in 1000:
		var body = body_scene.instance()
		var screen_size = get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size
		var x = rng.randi_range(0, screen_size.x)
		var y = rng.randi_range(0, screen_size.y)
		body.position = Vector2(x, y)
		body.left = i % 2 == 0
		add_child(body)
```

<br />

Each body moves and rotates on every physics update. My original game used `KinematicBody2D` instead of `Area2D` for the
bodies, but I realized that they should have been using `Area2D` with `monitoring` unchecked and `monitorable` checked,
since I didn't need the bodies to bounce off anything. So that's what we're going to use here.

```gdscript
# BodyST.gd
extends Area2D

var left = false
var speed = 50

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	move(delta)


func move(delta):
	var velocity = Vector2(5, 0) * speed * delta

	if left:
		rotation_degrees -= 4 * speed * delta
	else:
		rotation_degrees += 4 * speed * delta

	position += (velocity.rotated(deg2rad(rotation_degrees)))
```

<br />

When you play `Singlethreaded.tscn`, `BodySpawnerST` will do its thing and the bodies will cause the game to run at
~3fps. Using `_process` instead of `_physics_process` brings it up to ~22fps. I suspect this is because
`_physics_process` is forced to run every 1/60th of a second, but the time it take to move each body is longer than
that.

Having both `monitoring` and `monitorable` checked in `BodyST`'s `Area2D` brings the framerate down to ~18fps, and
unchecking both results in 120fps (my maximum framerate), which is the same as not having using `Area2D` at all.

(My fps measurements may not match yours if you download my project and run it.)

Now it's time to optimize!

## Running on multiple threads

In the multithreaded version, instead of each body calling its own `move` function every frame, `BodySpawnerMT` divides
the bodies among multiple threads which call each body's `move` function concurrently, every frame. So if there are 12
threads, each thread will be in charge of 1000/12 = 83 bodies with the last thread handling the 4 remainder bodies.

```gdscript
# BodySpawnerMT.gd
extends Node

var body_scene = preload("res://Multithreaded/BodyMT.tscn")
var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
var bodies = []
var threads = []
var num_threads = 12

func _ready() -> void:
	rng.randomize()

	for i in num_threads:
		var thread = Thread.new()
		threads.push_back(thread)

	for i in 1000:
		var body = body_scene.instance()
		var screen_size = get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size
		var x = rng.randi_range(0, screen_size.x)
		var y = rng.randi_range(0, screen_size.y)
		body.position = Vector2(x, y)
		body.left = i % 2 == 0
		add_child(body)
		bodies.push_back(body)


func _process(delta):
	for i in num_threads:
		threads[i].start(self, "move_bodies", {"delta": delta, "index": i})

	for i in num_threads:
		threads[i].wait_to_finish()


func move_bodies(args):
	# find start and end index in bodies that this thread will operate on
	var start = bodies.size() / num_threads * args.index
	var end = start + bodies.size() / num_threads
	# if the number of bodies is not divisible by num_threads,
	# add the remainder to the last thread
	if args.index == threads.size() - 1:
		end += bodies.size() % num_threads
	for i in range(start, end):
		bodies[i].move(args.delta)
```

Using multiple threads successfully gets the framerate to reach 60fps (and beyond)!

## Things to note

1.  **You cannot use Godot's physics engine in threads other than the main thread.** While I was still experimenting
    with `BodyMT` as a `KinematicBody2D`, I realized that calling `move_and_collide` in `BodyMT`'s `move` function threw
    this error:

    ```
    body_test_motion: Condition "main_thread != Thread::get_caller_id()" is true. Returned: false
    <C++ Source> servers/physics_2d/physics_2d_server_wrap_mt.h:260 @ body_test_motion()
    ```

    So I dug into Godot's source and found the
    [file in question](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/servers/physics_2d/physics_server_2d_wrap_mt.h).
    The `body_test_motion` function contained this line
    `ERR_FAIL_COND_V(main_thread != Thread::get_caller_id(), false);`. I could be wrong since I'm not at all familiar
    with this codebase, but it looks like it throws an error if it isn't called by the main thread.

    It also appears that you can't use your own threads in `_physics_process`. Using `_physics_process` instead of
    `_process` in `BodySpawnerMT` will cause the scene freeze at the Godot splash screen when you try playing it.

2.  **The framerate starts low and increases over the span of several seconds, depending on how many threads we use.**
    On my machine, using 4 threads takes 31 seconds to reach 60fps, 8 threads takes 10 seconds, and 12 threads or more
    takes 6 seconds. I never figured out why it takes time for the framerate to increase. I even
    [posted about this on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/iewqoz/why_does_multithreading_increase_the_framerate/)
    and still haven't found an answer. If you know why this happens, feel free to message me or reply on the Reddit
    post.

Using multiple threads isn't the only way to get a performance boost but it's an interesting one worth exploring. I'm
thinking of redoing this project as GDNative modules written in Rust sometime to see how much it increases performance.
Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in reading about!
