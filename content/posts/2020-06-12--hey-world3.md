Hey world, this is my first attempt at a blog! I'll mostly be posting about front-end web development, but will eventually start posting about game development with Godot Engine later on when I've made a bit more progress with that.

My next few posts will be tutorials on how I used JavaScript and CSS to create fun, interactive elements on my websites. See my portfolio website at [robynchoi.me](robynchoi.me) for some examples. If there's anything in any of my projects that you want to know more about, feel free to email me!

Also, in case you're curious, this blog was build off the [gatsby-v2-starter-lumen](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen) repo.
